            <strong>IceCubes</strong> are frozen water squares that chill and refresh any drink. Perfect for cocktails, sodas, or water, they keep beverages icy cold and are a must-have for any kitchen.
        </p>


        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 cups water (approximately)
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)
            </li>
            <li>
                4 cucumbers(have to be tiny)
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol reversed>
            <li>
                Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shut the door to the freezer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.
